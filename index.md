    <p>
        When I was very young I was sort of floored by the fact that my mother and my father 
        and everyone I knew was going to die one day, and myself too. I had a sort of philosophical
        crisis. I couldn't believe that we were mortal. For some reason that knowledge sort of
        overshadowed my experience. I was unhappy for some time. I got into a lot of trouble.
        I used to drink a lot. That was a hard time of my life.
