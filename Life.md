    <h2>Early life</h2>
    Elizabeth Woolridge Grant was born on June 21, 1985, in Manhatten, New York City,
    to Robert England Grant Jr. and Patricia Ann. She has a younger sister, Caroline, 
    and a younger brother, Charlie. She was raised Roman Catholic and is of Scottish
    descent. Her ancestors were from Lanarkshire. Shen she was one year old, the family
    moved to Lake Placid, New York. There, she attended St. Agnes School in her elementary
    years and began singing in her church choir, where she was the cantor.
    She attended the high school where her mother taught for one year, but when she was 15
    her parents sent her to Kent School to resolve a budding drinking problem.
    Her uncle, an admissions officer at the school, secured her financial aid to attend.
    According to Grant, she had trouble making friends during much of her teenage and 
    early adult years. She has said she was preocuppied with death from a young age, and 
    its role in her feelings of anxiety and alienation:

        When I was very young I was sort of floored by the fact that my mother and my father 
        and everyone I knew was going to die one day, and myself too. I had a sort of philosophical
        crisis. I couldn't believe that we were mortal. For some reason that knowledge sort of
        overshadowed my experience. I was unhappy for some time. I got into a lot of trouble.
        I used to drink a lot. That was a hard time of my life.
