    years and began singing in her church choir, where she was the cantor.
    She attended the high school where her mother taught for one year, but when she was 15
    her parents sent her to Kent School to resolve a budding drinking problem.
    Her uncle, an admissions officer at the school, secured her financial aid to attend.

    <p>
        When I was very young I was sort of floored by the fact that my mother and my father 
        and everyone I knew was going to die one day, and myself too. I had a sort of philosophical
        crisis. I couldn't believe that we were mortal. For some reason that knowledge sort of
        overshadowed my experience. I was unhappy for some time. I got into a lot of trouble.
        I used to drink a lot. That was a hard time of my life.
